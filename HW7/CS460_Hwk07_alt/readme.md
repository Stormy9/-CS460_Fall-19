So I totally get how to do this *(well, except for the personal token thing to get my private repos, I have had some trouble figuring **that** part out)* to make my own html/css/JavaScript-jQuery/ajax page and do what i need/want with the JSON data (which is saved to a local var and I pull out just the pieces I need and save those as local vars and display them) and there is no page re-load to get the table showing the commits for a repo.....

*(although figuring out how to access the correct repo to show the commits -- that was a fun challenge and satifying to accomplish)*

I was practicing working with jQuery/AJAX -- using AJAX to get JSON objects (some nested of course) and JSON arrays of objects (saving the JSON responses to a local variable) and pulling out what i need (and saving those pieces of data individually as local variables) and using jQuery to build a page -- including the commit tables that are brought in asynch (no reloading the page).  I had done that kind of thing before, but not for a year or two, and needed to "re-acclimate" to that in some way..... 

..... and got kinda carried away with that, and made the mistake of thinking that getting that part figured out and comfortable with that again would benefit me for this project in some way.  Obviously, I was wrong.  Plus I got carried away with all the cool stuff I was doing *(it was fun even though challenging)* especially the more things were working and I was figuring out the "pieces to the puzzle".  But still thinking that it would be of some benefit *(except it really wasn't)*.


I just don't get how the whole thing is structured in MVC..... I mean, I get it in basic concept/theory, yes..... but am lost at how to execute it and have had trouble finding things that will show good and appropriate demos/examples..... there are demo videos about making your own API in MVC -- but just with your own created data, not with data you pulled in from a public API.  And I liked the in-class demo, but by the time I get home and do everything so that I can sit down to work on this, it's difficult to remember everything from it and how it all fits and works together.   ]=

I am just confused and lost at how to structure and arrange this in MVC.   =(
I want to learn it and to know it and to get comfortable with it *(the latter at least to **some** degree!  i know it takes time and practice)* and I was starting to, with the db-related projects, but on this one, I just feel lost as to how to even begin and then structure/arrange things.
