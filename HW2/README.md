### and a bonus site  
i really wanted to figure out how to do a particular kind of calculation -- adding up the individual digits of an user-input integer -- with JavaScript!  

so I threw this together over the summer:  
<a href="https://stormy9.github.io/exp/numerology/life_path.html" target="_blank">numerology -- find your life path number</a>

see the code <a href="https://github.com/Stormy9/Stormy9.github.io/tree/master/exp/numerology" target="_blank">here</a>.

*(it's cool!  i converted the user input to individual digits, put the digits into an array, then added them all up... if the result was >9, so in other words more than two digits, it got broken up into individual digits again, and ran through the loop to add it up again -- as many times as necessary to arrive at the required single digit.)*  

*(i also did validation and used jQuery to make different things show up)*

*(i just didn't take the time to scour my numerology book to fill in actual results -- hahaha!   [=  )*

*(my original assignment was almost easier, but this one didn't have enough form elements and such -- just a cooler calculation process   [=  )*
