-- oh and the drop-down lists are all ordered now -- one of the easiest (and fastest) fixes ever, haha!

hadn't thought about this early enough.....
   but you should figure out how to make it so that when a coach is selected,
      the corresponding team is selected
         (and vice-versa(?))                    is that doable in the view?
                                                with drop-downs??

AND..... 
make 'Athletes.Index.cshtml' => with two links on each row.....
    one to bring up that athlete's "All Race Results" page, directly
    and one to bring up the page where you can select the event to make their graph for


you seriously need to learn more about/become more comfortable with 'ViewModels'
    update => i very much am, now..... 
        just not with f'ing 'IEnumerable'!!!


and with ajax calls from the controller via C# instead of just a JavaScript script
   (or some combination of that!)
   

i really wish someone would teach/show me how to do the AJAX, when some of the input
   comes from our database, which we then need to do a Query on -- to pull out the dates
   and finish times -- and pass those Query results (separately) back to the AJAX.....
   (at least as i get doing the plot.ly AJAX call?? we pass it a list of dates, and a 
    list of times -- and we get those from our Query on our database, right??)..... 
   
      there is something I am just not understanding here, the connections, and i've
      never seen an example or been taught this and can't find anything and am not even
      sure what to google..... haha!  sheesh. 
      

i'm gonna make new branches for working more on Feature Two + Feature Three on my own!
